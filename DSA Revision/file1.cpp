// Algorithms refer to the pseudo code that talks about the logic and stuff.
// Algorithms are written by domain experts.
// Algorithms can be specified into 3 different ways: Natural language, flow charts, pseudo code.
// Recursion is an application of stacks data structure.
// Types of recursion: direct and indirect.

// Example of direct recursion:
int func(int n){
    if (n==0)
        return 1;
    else
        return (func(n-1));   // Function is called directly
}

// Example of indirect recursion:
int func2(int n){
    
}
